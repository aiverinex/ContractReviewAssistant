Build a production-grade Python project named Contract Reviewer Crew, using the structure from the CrewAI Marketplace template (https://github.com/crewAIInc/marketplace-crew-template). This project is designed to be submitted to the CrewAI Marketplace (https://marketplace.crewai.com).
🎯 Project Purpose

Automate the legal contract review process:

    Ingest contracts (uploaded .txt or .pdf converted to text or .docx converted to text)

    Identify key clauses (e.g., indemnity, termination, exclusivity)

    Flag risks or vague language using GPT-4.0-mini

    Suggest redlines or legal comments

    Output a structured review summary

🧠 Agent Roles

    ClauseDetectorAgent: Finds important clauses and outputs a clause map

    RiskAnalysisAgent: Flags vague, risky, or one-sided clauses

    RedlineSuggesterAgent: Recommends redlines or rewrite suggestions

Each agent uses OpenAI GPT-4 to parse natural legal language.

⚙️ Runtime Behavior

    Load sample_contract.txt from sample_data/

    Process the full contract through all agents

    Print a final review report:

        Key clauses and their text

        Risk levels (low/medium/high)

        Suggested changes

    Save output to review_summary.txt or JSON

📖 README.md Must Include

🎯 Final Output:
A production-ready, modular contract review pipeline — AI-assisted, GPT-powered, and built to help legal teams scale reviews. Ready for GitHub push and CrewAI Marketplace submission.  Make no reference to or mention of "replit" within any text or files.
